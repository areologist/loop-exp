# Game Loop Experiment (loop-exp)

## What is this?

Part of spike: using DevTools to poke and prod at a game loop with and without Web Worker updates to understand performance characteristics.

Saved to GitHub because I kind of like the stack: TypeScript 2 + tape + yarn + webpack + react + stylus. Might want to copy it for future throwaway test projects.

**To Run**

-   Clone the repo.
-   With [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed run `yarn install`.
-   When complete, run `npm start`.

## To-do

*   Add additional test entities
*   Add a simple "player"
*   Create the multi engine with Web Worker updates
*   Write some test scenarios
*   Instrument the code

(*May not push future changes to GH since it's mainly here so I can use as seed for one-offs.*)
