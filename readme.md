# Game Loop Experiment (loop-exp)

## What is this?

Felt like using DevTools to poke and prod at a game loop with and without WebWorker updates to understand performance characteristics.

Saved to GitHub primarily because I kind of like the stack: TypeScript 2 + tape + yarn + webpack + react + stylus. Might want to use it for future throwaway test projects.

## To-do

* Add additional test entities
* Add a simple "player"
* Create the multi engine with WebWorker updates
* Write some test scenarios
* Instrument the code

(*Might not push future changes to GH since it's mainly here so I can use as seed for one-offs.*)
